# Unemployment Analysis in India

This project involves the analysis and visualization of unemployment data in India.

## Project Overview

1. Data Loading: The data, sourced from a CSV file, includes estimated employment and unemployment rates across different regions and areas of India.

2. Data Preprocessing: The 'Date' column is converted from a string format to a datetime format, which allows for more efficient time-based operations.

3. Data Visualization: The project includes several data visualization techniques:
    - Histograms: Employment and unemployment rates are visualized by region using histograms.
    - Bar Plots: Total employment and unemployment rates are visualized by region using bar plots.
    - Sunburst Chart: A sunburst chart is used to visualize the unemployment rate by state and region.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for statistical data visualization, and plotly for interactive graphing.

## How to Run

You can run the Jupyter notebook in an environment that has the necessary libraries installed. Make sure to update the path to the CSV file as per your directory structure.
